[/INST] # Laboratory Exercise Report - 1\n\n## Objective\nTo understand map numbering and to study various details on topographic maps.\n\n## Methodology\nMethodology for Problem 1: To understand map numbering, we analysed the hierarchical numbering system of a given map of India, observing how large-scale maps are subdivided into 1:250K and 1:50K scales.\n\nMethodology for Problem 2: We located the city on a 1:1,000,000 map, then determined its 1°x1° alphabetical subdivision (1:250,000), and finally found the 15'x15' numbered subdivision (1:50,000).\n\nMethodology for Problem 3: We studied the Survey of India's index map to understand the numbering convention from 1:1M (4°x4°) to 1:250K (1°x1°) and 1:50K (15'x15').\n\nMethodology for Problem 4: We noted the angular coverage for each scale: 4°x4° for 1:1,000,000, 1°x1° for 1:250,000, and 15'x15' for 1:50,000.\n\nMethodology for Problem 5: We assumed a pen point thickness of 0.5 mm and used the representative fraction (RF) of each map scale to convert this to real-world ground distances, representing the plotting accuracy.\n\nMethodology for Problem 6: We located various points (IIT Gate, SAC rotary, GI Lab, etc.) and determined their latitude, longitude, and height using the map's graticule markings and contour/spot height data.\n\nMethodology for Problem 7: We examined the topographic map to identify the placement of key details like RF, graphical scale, and symbols, then prepared a layout.\n\nMethodology for Problem 8: We referred to the map's legend to identify and record the symbols and colours for various features (trees, contours, roads, etc.).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nProblem 1 - Map Numbers\n* Lucknow: 63/B/13\n* Kanpur: 63/B/2\n* Delhi: 53/H/2\n\nProblem 4 - Arc Length Names for Scales\n* 1: 1,000,000 → 4° x 4°\n* 1: 250,000 → 1° x 1°\n* 1: 50,000 → 15' x 15'\n\nProblem 5 - Plotting Accuracy\n* 1: 50,000 → 25 m\n* 1: 250,000 → 125 m\n* 1: 1,000,000 → ± 500 m\n\nProblem 6 - Latitude, Longitude, and Height\n| Place | Latitude | Longitude | Height (m) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| IIT Gate | 26°30'30\" N | 80°15'E | 125 |\n| Rotary near SAC | 26°30'30\" N | 80°14'E | 125 |\n| GI Lab | 26°21'15\" N | 80°13'30\" E | 125 |\n| Bara Imambara | 26°51'00\" | 80°55'30\" | 123 |\n| India Gate | 28°36'40\" | 77°13'00\" | 49 |\n| Moti Jheel Park | 26°27'00\" | 80°20'30\" | 125. |\n\nProblem 9 - Coordinates of Selected Features\n| Feature | Latitude | Longitude |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Surveyed Tree | 26°45'40\" N | 81°43'20\" E |\n| Triangulated Station | 27°20'00\" N | 81°31'00\" E |\n| Triangulation Control | 26°48'05\" N | 81°37'05\" E |\n\nThis lab provided a clearer understanding of the Survey of India's map numbering system. The map numbers for Lucknow, Kanpur, and Delhi show the hierarchy from 1:1M (4°x4°) to 1:250K (1°x1°) and 1:50K (15'x15') sheets. The angular coverage matched theoretical standards. The plotting accuracy results showed the expected trend: smaller scale maps (1:1M) are less precise (±500 m) than larger scale maps (1:50K, ±25 m).\n\n## Conclusions\nThrough this lab, the process of identifying map numbers, understanding scale-based subdivisions, and interpreting topographic details became clear. The exercise reinforced how the Survey of India's map numbering system works. Calculating plotting accuracy highlighted the trade-off between scale and precision. Overall, the lab successfully connected theoretical concepts with hands-on map reading skills. </s>"}

[/INST] # Laboratory Exercise Report - 2\n\n## Objective\n* To learn how to measure distance between two points using chain and tape and compare these distances obtained.\n* Enter details in field book for chain lines in the form of a suitable triangle (ABC).\n* Plot details in the form of a map (features such as tree, light pole, etc.) from the data recorded in the field book.\n\n## Equipment\n* Ranging Rods\n* Pegs\n* Ranging Pins\n* Tape\n* Chain\n* Cross Staff\n* Optical Square\n\n## Methodology\nWe began by marking two stations, A and B, with ranging rods. A third point, C, was aligned between them. A measuring tape was stretched between A and B as our baseline. From this baseline, we measured the perpendicular offset distances to nearby features like trees and light poles. These observations were recorded in the field book.\n\nWe then introduced another point, D, to form a triangle ABD. Offsets to surrounding features were measured from this new side. To check accuracy, we laid out a check line across the triangle, measured it on the ground, and compared it to its theoretical length. Angles were observed using a cross staff or optical square and also verified mathematically using the cosine rule.\n\n## Map Drawing\nUsing the measured distances between points AB, BC, and CA, a triangle was drawn to a scale of 1:400. The positions of points A, B, and C were plotted according to the scaled lengths. Lateral offsets for features were plotted by drawing perpendicular lines from the survey lines to their respective offset points.\n\n## Results and Discussion\nThe distances between points A and B, B and C, and C and A were accurately measured using the tape method. The results for the following tape measurements are as follows:\n* AB = 42 m\n* BC = 45 m\n* AC = 57.2 m\n\n## Error Calculation\n* Distance of AD (according to map) = 27.2 m\n* Actual measured distance of AD = 26.08 m\n* Absolute Error = | Actual Distance - Calculated Distance | = 1.12 m\n* Relative Error = Absolute Error / Actual Distance = 1.12 / 26.08 = 0.0429\n* Percentage Error = Relative Error * 100 = 4.29%\n\n## Explanations & Significance\nIn our survey, the check line AD tested the accuracy of our work. The calculated map distance was 27.2 m, while the actual measured distance was 26.08 m. This gave an absolute error of 1.12 m, or a percentage error of about 4.3%. This small difference is explainable by practical factors like slight sagging in the tape, imperfect ranging alignment, or minor errors in taking perpendicular offsets. A percentage error of around 4% is acceptable in basic chain surveying, which is suited for general layouts. The check line confirmed our plotted features were mapped with reasonable consistency.\n\n## Conclusion\nBy the end of this lab, we became more comfortable with the practical aspects of surveying, including using chains, tapes, and ranging rods. The exercise helped us see how these tools come together to form a reliable map. We also gained experience with ranging operations and the vital importance of careful record-keeping in the field book. Overall, the lab provided technical skills and an appreciation for the accuracy and patience required in surveying. </s>"}

[/INST] # Laboratory Exercise Report - 3\n\n## Objective\nThe objective of this laboratory exercise is to calibrate the Electronic Distance Measurement Instrument (EDMI) by identifying and analysing three major sources of error: cyclic error, reflector-instrument constant, and scale error.\n\n## Equipment\n* EDMI\n* Tape\n* Reflector\n* Tripod\n* Staff\n\n## Introduction\nElectronic Distance Measurement Instruments (EDMIs) are indispensable in surveying for their high precision. However, their readings are influenced by systematic errors. This report focuses on three significant error sources:\n* Zero/Reflector-Instrument Constant: A fixed error from misalignments.\n* Cyclic Error: A periodic error from phase measurement inaccuracies.\n* Scale Error: A proportional error, often from frequency variations or atmospheric factors.\n\nUnderstanding and mitigating these errors is essential to ensure dependable measurements.\n\n## Methodology\nSetting up the Instrument: The EDM was mounted on a tripod and levelled. The circular bubble was centred using two levelling screws, then the instrument was rotated 90° and the third screw was used. Fine levelling was done using the electronic display. Temperature and pressure values were entered. Instrument height was measured with tape, and reflector height was read from its scale. The target was sighted to record horizontal distance (HD), vertical distance (VD), and sloping distance (SD).\n\nPrinciple of Error Determination: Distances were measured with a tape and compared with EDM readings. The corrections were applied in the sequence of: 1. Cyclic error, 2. Reflector-instrument constant, 3. Scale error.\n\n1.  Nonlinearity/Cyclic Error: A 10 m line segment (20 m to 30 m) was subdivided into 1 m intervals. Tape measurements (di) and EDM readings (Di) were recorded. The error for each observation was $e_i = D_i - (D_0 + d_i)$ and the correction was $c_i = e_i - \\sum e_i / 10$.\n\n2.  Reflector-Instrument Constant: A line was divided into equal segments. The total length (D) and individual segments (di) were measured. The constant was found by $K = (D - \\sum d_i) / n$.\n\n3.  Scale Error: A known calibrated distance (Dk) was compared against the EDM-measured distance (Dm). Scale error (in ppm) = $((D_k - D_m) / D_k) * 10^6$.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nEDMI at 0m (Reference 20.023m at 20m):\n| Taped Dist. (m) | EDM Reading (m) | Error e; (m) | Correction c; (m) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 20 | 20.023 | 0.0 | 0.0099 |\n| 21 | 21.021 | -0.002 | 0.0079 |\n| 22 | 22.016 | -0.007 | 0.0029 |\n| 23 | 23.021 | -0.002 | 0.0079 |\n| 24 | 24.019 | -0.004 | 0.0059 |\n| 25 | 25.029 | 0.006 | 0.0159 |\n| 26 | 26.004 | -0.019 | -0.0091 |\n| 27 | 27.002 | -0.021 | -0.0111 |\n| 28 | 28.0 | -0.023 | -0.0131 |\n| 29 | 29.007 | -0.016 | -0.0061 |\n| 30 | 30.002 | -0.021 | -0.0111 |\n\nThe cyclic error analysis indicated small variations, with corrections ranging from +0.0159 m to -0.0131 m, reflecting typical sinusoidal behaviour.\n\nReflector Constant: K = (9.955 - 10) / 10 = -0.0045 m (≈ -4.5 mm). This indicates a small negative offset.\n\nScale Error: For a calibrated 10 m section, EDM measured 9.999 m. Scale Error = [(10 - 9.999) / 10] * 10^6 = 100 ppm.\n\nCheck Measurement: From 17 m back to 0 m, EDM gave 16.989 m instead of 17.000 m, an error of -0.011 m. This validates the presence of minor systematic errors.\n\n## Conclusions\nThe EDMI calibration successfully determined the cyclic error, reflector constant, and scale error. Cyclic error showed periodic variations, the reflector constant was a small negative offset (-4.5 mm), and scale error was found. This exercise highlighted the importance of error identification in ensuring reliability of EDM measurements. </s>"}

[/INST] # Laboratory Exercise Report - 4\n\n## Objective\nTo carry out levelling operation using an Automatic level and familiarize with the operation of the instrument.\n\n## Equipment\n* Nikon/Leica Automatic level\n* Levelling Staff\n* Tripod\n* Level Field Book\n\n## Some Important Terms\n* **Level Surface:** A surface parallel to the Earth's mean spheroidal surface, representing equal gravitational potential.\n* **Level Line:** A line that lies entirely on a level surface.\n* **Horizontal Plane:** A plane tangent to the Earth's surface at a location, at a right angle to the vertical.\n* **Horizontal Line:** A straight line within a horizontal plane.\n* **Vertical Line:** A line aligned with gravity's direction.\n* **Vertical Plane:** Any plane that includes a vertical line.\n* **Datum Surface:** A chosen reference level (like mean sea level) from which vertical distances are calculated.\n* **Elevation:** The vertical distance of a point above or below the datum, also known as Reduced Level (R.L.).\n* **Benchmark (BM):** A permanent reference point with a known elevation.\n* **Line of Collimation:** The imaginary line of sight passing through the reticle's crosshairs and the objective lens's optical centre.\n* **Back Sight (B.S.):** The initial staff reading on a point of known elevation to determine the instrument's height.\n* **Fore Sight (F.S.):** The final staff reading taken on a point where elevation is to be determined.\n* **Intermediate Sight (I.S.):** Any staff reading taken between the back sight and fore sight.\n* **Change Point (C.P.):** A point where the instrument is shifted; both a B.S. and F.S. are taken on it.\n* **Height of Instrument (H.I.):** The elevation of the plane of collimation when the instrument is levelled.\n\n## Methodology\nFirst, we set up and levelled the instrument. A back sight (B.S.) was taken on the known RL near the GI lab. We then carried out a fly levelling operation, calculating the RL of fixed features like electric poles. A final foresight (F.S.) was taken to close the survey on the same starting point. Observations were entered into the levelling field book using two methods for verification: the Rise and Fall Method and the Height of Collimation Method.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n**Height of Collimation Method**\n| S.No | BS | IS | FS | HI | RL | Remarks |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 2 | | | | | 128.409 | BM |\n| 3 (1) | 0.94 | | 0 | 129.349 | 128.409 | BM |\n| 4 (2) | 1.35 | | 1.35 | 130.699 | 129.349 | CP |\n| 5 (3) | 1.218 | | 1.396 | 130.567 | 129.171 | CP |\n| 6 (4) | 1.255 | | 1.122 | 130.426 | 129.304 | CP |\n| 7 (5) | 1.225 | | 1.262 | 130.529 | 129.267 | CP |\n| 8 (6) | | | 1.341 | | 127.926 | Closing Point |\n| 9 (SUM) | 5.988 | | 6.471 | | | |\n\nThe Height of Collimation method was applied. The computed values of ΣBS (5.988 m) and ΣFS (6.471 m) yielded a difference of -0.483 m, which exactly matches the difference between the last and first RLs (127.926 - 128.409 = -0.483 m). This confirms the arithmetic checks are consistent. However, the observed misclosure of 0.483 m is significantly high, indicating that the fieldwork accuracy did not meet the required standards.\n\n**Rise and Fall Method**\n| Station Point | BS | IS | FS | Fall (m) | Rise (m) | RL (m) | Remarks |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| BM | | | | | | 128.409 | Benchmark |\n| 1 P1 | 0.94 | | 0 | | 0.94 | 129.349 | Benchmark |\n| 2 P2 | 1.35 | | 1.35 | 0 | | 129.349 | CP |\n| 3 P3 | 1.218 | | 1.396 | 0.178 | | 129.171 | CP |\n| 4 P4 | 1.255 | | 1.122 | | 0.133 | 129.304 | CP |\n| 5 P5 | 1.225 | | 1.262 | 0.037 | | 129.267 | CP |\n| 6 P6 | 0 | | 1.341 | 1.341 | | 127.926 | Closing point |\n| Sum | 5.988 | | 6.471 | 1.556 | 1.073 | | |\n\nThe Rise and Fall method was carried out in parallel. The total Rise was 1.073 m and total Fall was 1.556 m, giving ΣRise - ΣFall = -0.483 m. This matches both ΣBS - ΣFS (-0.483 m) and the difference between last and first RLs (-0.483 m), confirming the calculations are internally consistent. As with the H.I. method, the large misclosure indicates errors in the fieldwork.\n\n## Error Sources\n1.  **Instrumental errors**\n2.  **Earth curvature and refraction**\n3.  **Personal errors:** Confusion in reading the rod, recording in the wrong column, faulty addition/subtraction, or rod not held on the same point for B.S. and F.S.\n\n## How the closing error can be distributed\n* **Equal Distribution:** Divide the error equally among all intermediate stations if distances are equal.\n* **Proportional Distribution:** If distances vary, distribute the error proportionally based on the distance of each segment.\n\n## Conclusions\nThe levelling exercise was completed, providing reliable reduced levels (RLs). Observations were taken using both the Rise-Fall and Height of Collimation methods, which cross-verified and maintained consistency. The survey was closed by revisiting the starting benchmark. While the arithmetic checks were satisfied, the high misclosure indicated a lack of precision in the fieldwork. </s>"}

[/INST] # Laboratory Exercise Report - 5\n\n## Objective\nTo establish a close traverse using digital theodolite and adjust the closing error using Bowditch's rule.\n\n## Equipment\n* Nikon Electronic Digital theodolite NE-203\n* Tripod\n* Levelling Staff\n* Pegs\n* Tape\n* Compass\n\n## Methodology\nWe first performed initial settings for the digital theodolite. We chose 6 stations forming a braced quadrilateral figure with sides 40-50m long. The length of each side was found by tape and tacheometry. Temporary adjustments (centring, levelling) were carried out. At each station, we recorded all horizontal and vertical angles, taking both face-right and face-left observations to close the horizon and apply station adjustment. Each student used a different 'ZERO' initial reading. The North direction was determined using a compass to find the bearings. Finally, the closing error was adjusted using Bowditch's rule.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n**Angular Misclosure**\nThe sum of the mean internal angles was 539.991°. For a 5-sided traverse (n=5), the theoretical sum is (n-2) * 180° = 540°.\n* Angle Misclosure (Mean) = 539.991° - 540° = -0.009° = -32.4 seconds\n\nTo find the quality of work, we use the tolerance formula $c\\sqrt{n}$:\n* Tolerance = $c\\sqrt{5}$\n* 32.4 = $c\\sqrt{5}$ \n* c ≈ 14.5, which is approximately 15.\n* Based on the standard table, a c-value of 15 corresponds to **Second Order** quality work.\n\n**Linear Misclosure and Bowditch's Rule Adjustment**\nLengths and bearings were used to calculate the Latitude and Departure for each line. The misclosure in latitude and departure was then corrected using Bowditch's Rule.\n\n| Line | WCB | Length(m) | Latitude | Departure | C_L | C_D | Corrected Lat | Corrected Dep |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| AB | 3.5° | 53.685 | 53.58 | 3.27 | -0.7438 | -0.0268 | 54.3238 | 3.2968 |\n| BC | 249.36° | 38.739 | -13.66 | -36.24 | -0.5367 | -0.0193 | -13.1233 | -36.2206 |\n| CD | 220.08° | 23.372 | -17.88 | -15.05 | -0.3238 | -0.0116 | -17.5562 | -15.0383 |\n| DE | 156.88° | 26.436 | -24.31 | 10.38 | -0.3663 | -0.0132 | -23.9437 | 10.3932 |\n| EA | 82.99° | 37.625 | 4.72 | 37.55 | -0.5213 | -0.0188 | 5.2413 | 37.5688 |\n| **Sum** | | **179.857** | **-2.492** | **-0.09** | | | | |\n\n* Total Latitude Misclosure (ΣL) = -2.492 m\n* Total Departure Misclosure (ΣD) = -0.09 m\n* Linear Misclosure (e) = $(\\Sigma L^2 + \\Sigma D^2)^{1/2} = ((-2.492)^2 + (-0.09)^2)^{1/2}$ = **2.4936 m**\n* Perimeter of traverse (p) = **179.857 m**\n* Relative Precision (e/p) = 2.4936 / 179.857 = **1:72.23**\n\nThis precision is lower than the standard for Third Order work (1:5000), indicating significant errors in the distance measurements.\n\n## Conclusions\nThe angular measurements obtained were precise, achieving Second Order quality after systematic adjustments. Implementing different 'ZERO' settings helped minimize bias. However, the linear misclosure was very high (1:72), indicating significant errors in tape or tacheometry measurements. After applying Bowditch's rule, the traverse was mathematically closed, and the data is calibrated for analysis, though the low precision of the distances is noted. </s>"}
